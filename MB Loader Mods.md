## How to access the files in these mod APKs?

### Method using NMM:

2. Open app and allow storage or files permission 
3. Tap ≡ in top left corner, then tap + in the top of the side-menu
4. In "Add storage" window, choose "External Storage".
5. A different files app should now open, now tap ≡ in top left corner.
6. In the side menu, choose "MB Loader" or "Draco Loader" or "MB2 Loader"
7. This step is different depending on your Minecraft settings:
- If your "storage" in Minecraft settings is set to "External", tap these following the sequence: `android_data` → `files` → `games` → `com.mojang` . Then tap "USE THIS FOLDER" near the bottom edge. Then tap ALLOW.
- If your "storage" in Minecraft settings is set to "Application", tap these following the sequence: `data` → `games` → `com.mojang` . Then tap "USE THIS FOLDER" near the bottom edge. Then tap ALLOW.
